Question 1. Algebra: solve quadratic equations

1. Key Function Analysis
The program solves a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The key logic resides in the main function:
1. It reads three coefficients a, b, and c from the user.
2. It calculates the discriminant d = b^2 - 4ac.
3. It uses conditional statements (if-else) to handle three cases:
   - If d > 0, there are two distinct real roots. The roots are calculated using the quadratic formula: r1,2 = (-b +/- sqrt(d)) / 2a.
   - If d = 0, there is one real root (repeated), calculated as r = -b / 2a.
   - If d < 0, the equation has no real roots.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input: 1.0 3 1
Output:
Enter a, b, c: 1.0 3 1
The roots are -0.381966 and -2.61803
Analysis: Discriminant is positive (3^2 - 4(1)(1) = 5), resulting in two real roots.


Question 2. Geometry: area of a regular polygon

1. Key Function Analysis
The program calculates the area of a regular polygon.
1. It prompts the user for the number of sides n and the length of a side s.
2. It uses the mathematical formula: Area = (n * s^2) / (4 * tan(PI / n)).
3. The value of PI is defined as a constant 3.14159. The tan function from <cmath> is used for the calculation.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input: 5 6.5
Output:
Enter the number of sides: 5
Enter the length of a side: 6.5
The area of the polygon is 72.6903


Question 3. Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers

1. Key Function Analysis
The program reads an unspecified number of integers until 0 is entered.
1. It initializes counters for positive numbers, negative numbers, total count, and a sum accumulator.
2. A while loop continues as long as the input num is not 0.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the number is positive or negative and increments the respective counter. It also adds the number to sum.
4. Finally, it calculates the average (casting sum to double to ensure floating-point division) and prints the statistics.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input: 1 2 -1 3 0
Output:
Enter an integer value, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 -1 3 0
The number of positives is 3
The number of negatives is 1
The total value is 5
The average value is 1.25


Question 4. Convert binary to decimal

1. Key Function Analysis
The function solve_bin_to_dec converts a binary string to a decimal integer.
1. It iterates through the binary string from the last character (least significant bit) to the first.
2. It maintains a power variable (initially 1, representing 2^0).
3. If the current character is '1', it adds the current power value to the decimal result.
4. In each iteration, power is multiplied by 2.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input: 11001
Output:
Enter a bianry number: 11001
25
Analysis: 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25.


Question 5. Distinct numbers

1. Key Function Analysis
The program reads ten numbers and displays only the distinct ones.
1. It uses an array numbers to store distinct values found so far.
2. For each input number, it iterates through the stored numbers to check for duplicates.
3. If the number is not found in the array (isDistinct is true), it is added to the array, and the size counter is incremented.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input: 1 2 3 2 1 6 3 4 5 2
Output:
Enter ten integers: 1 2 3 2 1 6 3 4 5 2
The number of distinct numbers is 6
The distinct numbers are: 1 2 3 6 4 5


Question 6. Sum elements column by column

1. Key Function Analysis
The function sumColumn calculates the sum of elements in a specific column of a matrix.
1. It takes a 2D array m, the number of rows, and the target columnIndex as arguments.
2. It iterates through the rows (i from 0 to rowSize - 1) while keeping the column index fixed.
3. It accumulates the values into sum and returns the result.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
Output:
Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row by row: 
Sum of the elements at column 0 is 15
Sum of the elements at column 1 is 18
Sum of the elements at column 2 is 21
Sum of the elements at column 3 is 24


Question 7. The Rectangle class

1. Key Function Analysis
The Rectangle class encapsulates the properties of a rectangle.
1. Constructors: A default constructor initializes width and height to 1. A parameterized constructor allows setting custom dimensions.
2. Accessors/Mutators: getWidth, setWidth, etc., allow controlled access to private data members.
3. Methods: getArea() returns width * height, and getPerimeter() returns 2 * (width + height).

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case:
Creating two rectangles:
1. Width 4, Height 40
2. Width 3.5, Height 35.9

Output:
Rectangle 1:
Width: 4 Height: 40
Area: 160 Perimeter: 88
Rectangle 2:
Width: 3.5 Height: 35.9
Area: 125.65 Perimeter: 78.8


Question 8. The Rectangle2D class

1. Key Function Analysis
The Rectangle2D class extends the concept to a 2D plane with a center point (x, y).
1. contains(double x, double y): Checks if a point is within the rectangle boundaries by comparing coordinates against x +/- width/2 and y +/- height/2.
2. contains(const Rectangle2D &r): Checks if another rectangle r is entirely inside the current one.
3. overlaps(const Rectangle2D &r): Checks if two rectangles intersect. It returns true unless they are completely separated (e.g., one is to the left of the other).

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case:
Rectangle r1 at (2, 2) with width 5.5, height 4.9.
Output:
Area: 26.95
Perimeter: 20.8
Contains (3, 3): true
Contains (4.75, 2): false


Question 9. The Bounding Rectangle

1. Key Function Analysis
The getRectangle function calculates the bounding box for a set of 2D points.
1. It iterates through the array of points to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates (minX, maxX, minY, maxY).
2. The width of the bounding rectangle is maxX - minX.
3. The height is maxY - minY.
4. The center (x, y) is the midpoint: minX + width / 2 and minY + height / 2.

2. Program Testing and Execution
Test Case 1:
Input 5 points: 1.0 2.5, 3 4, 5 6, 7 8, 9 10
Output:
Enter five points: 1.0 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
The bounding rectangle's center (5, 6.25), width 8, height 7.5
